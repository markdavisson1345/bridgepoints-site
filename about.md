## Our Mission

BridgePoints exists to provide meaningful, industry-connected internship opportunities for high school students. We serve as a bridge between schools, industry partners, and motivated students.

## Our Vision

We believe all students—regardless of background, zip code, or resources—deserve a first chance to succeed in technology-driven fields.

## Our Story

Founded by Josiah Davisson, a veteran computer science teacher, BridgePoints was created to streamline the connection between classroom learning and real-world experience.
