## School-Based Internship Programs

BridgePoints facilitates internship programs on school campuses, led by CTE teachers. These internships:

- Take place during or after the school day
- Are flexible in pay, hours, and format
- Focus on real-world experience in tech, software, and game development

Programs are shaped in collaboration with local industry partners and school districts.
