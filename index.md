# BridgePoints  
### Connecting Students to Opportunity

BridgePoints connects students with real-world learning experiences through on-site internships at schools, facilitated by certified CTE teachers. We empower students to gain industry-relevant experience in software, game development, and technology-related fieldsâ€”right from their campus.

> We're committed to breaking barriers to opportunity for every student.
